\arguments{
\item{targetCohortId}{the Id of the target cohort}

\item{targetCohortName}{the name of the target cohort}

\item{eventCohortIds}{the ids of the event cohorts}

\item{eventCohortNames}{the names of the event cohorts}

\item{includeTreatments}{Include treatments starting ('startDate') or ending ('endDate') after target cohort start date}

\item{periodPriorToIndex}{Number of days prior to the index date of the target cohort that event cohorts are allowed to start}

\item{minEraDuration}{Minimum time an event era should last to be included in analysis}

\item{eraCollapseSize}{Window of time between which two eras of the same event cohort are collapsed into one era}

\item{combinationWindow}{Window of time two event cohorts need to overlap to be considered a combination treatment}

\item{minPostCombinationDuration}{Minimum time an event era before or after a generated combination treatment should last to be included in analysis}

\item{filterTreatments}{Select first occurrence of ("First") / changes between ("Changes') / all event cohorts ("All")}

\item{maxPathLength}{Maximum number of steps included in treatment pathway (max 5)}

\item{minCellCount}{Minimum number of persons with a specific treatment pathway for the pathway to be included in analysis}

\item{minCellMethod}{Select to completely remove / sequentially adjust (by removing last step as often as necessary) treatment pathways below minCellCount}

\item{groupCombinations}{Select to group all non-fixed combinations in one category 'otherâ€™ in the sunburst plot}

\item{addNoPaths}{Select to include untreated persons without treatment pathway in the sunburst plot}

\item{strata}{a strata object of stratification settings}

\description{
This function adopts ideas from TreatmentPatterns::addPathwayAnalysis and
builds the settings needed for a drug utilization study.
